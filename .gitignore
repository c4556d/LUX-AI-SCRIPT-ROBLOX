The modified file `"LUX` appears to be a source file or configuration file that doesn't match any of the common ignore patterns (no file extension, not a build artifact, dependency directory, or temporary file). Since it's not a compiled file, dependency, or temporary artifact, it should not be added to .gitignore.

No .gitignore rules are needed based on the provided file changes.
